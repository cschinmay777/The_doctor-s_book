# Doctors' Book App

A common man immediately contacts his family doctor in case he suspects any change in his physical health. Everytime we visit our doc, he or she puts in efforts to search our old record in his old slam book cum diary. Sometimes doctors even forget to mention some details that can be useful for the next visits. 

Hence, we're presenting this android application where doctors can record and search easily for their patients details.
